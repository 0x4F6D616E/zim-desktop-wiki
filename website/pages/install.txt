====== Install ======

	**NOTE:** To test zim it is not needed to install zim at all. You should be able to run it directly from the source directory by calling `''./zim.py''`.

First you should verify you have the dependencies zim needs.  You will at least need the following:

* gtk+ >= 2.6
* python >= 2.5
* python-gtk
* python-gobject
* python-simplejson (for python < 2.6)
* python-xdg (optional, but recommended)
* xdg-utils (optional, but recommended)

To verify zim is working properly on your system you can call the test suite using `''./test.py''`. Failures do not have to be critical, but in theory all tests should pass.

Zim can be installed from source using:

'''
./setup.py install
'''

Most plugins have additional requirements. These are listed in the plugin
descriptions.


===== Ubuntu =====
On Ubuntu or other debian derived systems, the following packages should be installed:

* python
* libgtk2.0-0
* xdg-utils
* python-gtk2
* python-xdg


===== Windows =====
To install gtk, python and python-gtk on Windows see the instructions at http://www.pygtk.org . If you use python 2.5 you will also need to install the python simplejson module. This can be obtained from http://pypi.python.org. The python-xdg module is not usefull on Windows, so you can skip it.

Once the dependencies are fulfilled you can run zim directly from the source directory.


===== Mac OS X =====
You can run zim on mac if you have the proper dependencies installed.
If you are using Mac Ports than installing the following ports should work:

* python25
* py25-gtk
* py25-simplejson
* py25-xdg


===== Install Paths =====
If you install in a non-default location you may need to set the PYTHONPATH environment variable in order for zim to find it's python modules. For example, if you installed the modules below "/home/user/lib/zim" you need to set:

	PYTHONPATH=/home/user/lib

Also zim uses the XDG paths to locate data and config files. If you get an error that zim can not find it's data files For example, if you installed the zim data files to "/home/user/share/zim"
you need to set the data path like this:

	XDG_DATA_DIRS=/home/user/share:/usr/local/share:/usr/share
