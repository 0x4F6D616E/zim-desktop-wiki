====== Task List ======

The Task List plugin adds a dialog that lists open items across all pages of the current notebook. In a way it is a specialized search function. An open item or task is defined by a single line and can have tags and a priority.

**Dependencies:** This plugin has no additional dependencies.

**Note:** See also the [[Usage:Getting Things Done|Getting Things Done]] use case.


===== Using Checkboxes =====
The first way to use the task list is to define open items by checkboxes. A list like this will be interpreted as a task list and each individual line will appear in the task list dialog.

[ ] Buy rice @groceries
[ ] Call Susan to invite for diner !
[ ] Print menu @desk

In this example the second item will have the highest priority because of the "!", the more exclamation marks the higher the priority. Also the words with an "@" will be considered tags, so the dialog will show the tags "groceries" and "desk" which can be used for filtering the task list.

===== Using tags =====
The second way to use the task list is by using tags like "TODO" or "FIXME" in your notes. Unfortunately this functionality has not yet been ported in this version of zim.
