====== Task List ======

The Task List plugin adds a dialog that lists open items across all pages of the current notebook. In a way it is a specialized search function. An open item or task is defined by a single line and can have tags and a priority.

**Dependencies:** This plugin has no additional dependencies.

**See also:** [[Usage:Getting Things Done]]

===== Options =====
This plugin has two options that can be configured:

If the option "**Consider all checkboxes as tasks**" is enabled any checkboxes found will appear in the task list. If it is disabled only checkboxes that have a task label (like "FIXME" or "TODO") will appear in the list.

The option **Labels marking tasks** gives a comma separated list of labels that are used to flag tasks. By default these are "TODO" and "FIXME" but this can be customized.

If **Use date from journal pages** is enabled, tasks found in pages that belong to the [[Journal|Journal plugin]] will get that calendar date as starting date and/or due date. If the calendar page covers multiple days (e.g. a weekly page) the last day of the period will be taken as the due date while for the start day the first day will be used.

The options **Section(s) to index** and **Section(s) to ignore** can be used to limit the namespaces that are indexed for tasks. By default the whole notebook is used, but if either of these options or both these options are set, only a limited set is indexed. Multiple namespaces can be given separated by a "'',''".

The options **Show tasklist in sidepane** and **Position in the window** allow to embed the tasklist in one of the side panes of the window.

==== Context menu ====
The context menu of the tasklist (the "right click" menu) has two further options to control the view:

When **Show Tasks as Flat List** is enabled only tasks are shown that have no open child tasks. This flattens the hierarchic view to a flat list with the lowest level tasks that are open. This is use full when you use nested tasks to detail out a complex tasks into smaller steps. In this view the next steps are shown for all tasks.

When **Only Show Active Tasks** is enabled tasks with a start date in the future are hidden.

===== Usage =====

==== Using Checkboxes ====
The first way to use the task list is to define open items by checkboxes. A list like this will be interpreted as a task list and each individual line will appear in the task list dialog.

	[ ] Buy rice @groceries
	[ ] Call Susan to invite for diner [d: 5/1] !
	[ ] Print menu @desk

In this example the second item will have the highest **priority** because of the "!", the more exclamation marks the higher the priority. Also the words with an "@" will be considered **tags**, so the dialog will show the tags "groceries" and "desk" which can be used for filtering the task list.

A **due date** can be added by putting a date in between "[d: ]". Zim parses a couple of date formats:

'''
dd/mm		dd-mm
dd/mm/yy	dd-mm-yy
dd/mm/yyyy	dd-mm-yyyy
yyyy/mm/dd	yyyy-mm-dd
'''

So you can use e.g. "[d: 5/1]", "[d: 2010-1-5]" or "[d: 5/1/10]". (Any other separator character to separate year, month, and day will also work, as long as it is not a number or a letter.)

**Note: **dates are parse in European notation, so "dd/mm", not as "mm/dd" as is customary in the US. Unfortunately there is no way to resolve these unambiguously.

A task in a checkbox list can also have sub-items. This can help enormously to split up a complex task in step by step action items. For example:

	[ ] Organize party [d: 19/8] !
		[ ] Send invitations [d: 1/8] !!
		[ ] Cleanup living room
			[ ] Get rid of moving boxes [d: 10/8]
			[ ] Buy vacuum cleaner [d: 15/8]
		[ ] Buy food & drinks

Such sub-items will also show up in the tasklist as sub-items below the main task in a hierarchic tree. Note that sub-items that do not have an explicit due date or priority set will inherit these from the main task. So in this example the "//send invitations//" action an earlier due date and a higher priority, while the "//cleanup living room//" and "//buy food & drinks//" items inherit due date and priority from the main task.

==== Using labels ====
The second way to use the task list is by using labels like "TODO" or "FIXME" in your notes. Labels can appear at the start of a line or directly after a checkbox. The rest of the lines is parsed the same as a task description after a checkbox. So the following will also be considered a task:

	FIXME: finish the previous paragraph

Different labels can be used similar to tags to distinguish different categories of tasks.

As a special case labels can be used to flag a whole list being a task list. In that case the tag needs to start a new paragraph and be on a line by itself before the first checkbox. This usage is especially useful when the option "Consider all checkboxes as tasks" is turned off. Any tags on this first line will be applied to the whole list. However no other words should appear as that would make this first line a regular item and cause the list to be ignored. An example of this usage is as follows:

	TODO: @home
	[ ] Call Susan to invite for diner [d: 5/1] !
	[ ] Print menu @desk

Now both items will get the tag "@home" appended.
