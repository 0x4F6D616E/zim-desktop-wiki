If the Zim application icon has changed, you must manually rebuild it
here before running the Windows build scripts.

1. Using IcoFX (free software), import Zim's zim16.png, zim32.png, and
zim48.png to a fresh ICO file.

2. Using InkScape, convert zim48.svg to a temporary 256x256 PNG file
and import that into the same ICO file as step 1.

3. Save as ./windows/zim.ico .
