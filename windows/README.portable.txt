Zim Desktop Wiki Portable
-------------------------

Place any existing notebooks you want to carry with you in
"./Data/Notebooks".

Each time Zim starts, any notebooks in this folder will be registered
with Zim. If there is a notebook with the folder name "Default" or
there is only one notebook, then that notebook will be opened;
otherwise, the Open Notebook dialog will appear.
