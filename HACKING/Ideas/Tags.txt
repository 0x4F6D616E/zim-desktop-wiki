====== Tags ======

One way to work with tags is to link pages to a special tag page and use back links to track all pages that have this tag. The main thing a tag plugin would do is add UI elements for this way of working.

* Autocomplete tags, e.g. drop down if you type "@" with known tags
* Autolink tags when they are typed
* Make tag pages really special and autogenerate them with a list of links
	* This could be build on top of [[SavedSearch]]
* Tag based side pane view to replace hierarchy view
	* This would mean caching tags per page in the index database
* Integrate tags better in the search dialog ? 
* Integrate tags better in the Taks List  dialog ?
* Add a tag cload somwhere ?

As an alternative, how about adding an entry on the bottom of the page for listing tags ?
Separate them from content, but add them as special links in properties / contents
Have an "+" icon that shows a popup of known tags
Might work nicer

Really need good interface to browse by tag - especially for photos
