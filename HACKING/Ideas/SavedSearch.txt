====== SavedSearch ======
Created Thursday 30 July 2009

Saved Search would be generic interface used for e.g. by [[Task List]] plugin or a [[Tags]] plugin. It would use a table in the index database to account which page matches what search. This table would be updated all the time by hooking the queries into updates of the database.

Need two signals on index
* One for init to create the tables
* One on index page to run the queries

As a seperate feature it would be nice to have special pages, which are read-only and have links to all matches. Or should this go into a special UI element, e.g. in the side pane ?
