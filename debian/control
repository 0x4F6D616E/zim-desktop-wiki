Description: A Desktop Wiki Editor
 Zim is a graphical text editor used to maintain a collection of wiki pages. Each page can contain links to other pages, simple formatting and images. Pages are stored in a folder structure, like in an outliner, and can have attachments. Creating a new page is as easy as linking to a nonexistent page. All data is stored in plain text files with wiki formatting. Various plugins provide additional functionality, like a task list manager, an equation editor, a tray icon, and support for version control.
.
Zim can be used to:
  * Keep an archive of notes
  * Take notes during meetings or lectures
  * Organize task lists
  * Draft blog entries and emails
  * Do brainstorming
