Description: graphical text editor based on wiki technologies
 Zim is a WYSIWYG text editor. It aims at bringing the concept of a wiki to
 your desktop. For example every page is saved as a text file with wiki markup.
 Pages can contain links to other pages, and are saved automatically. Creating
 a new page is as easy as linking to a non-existing page. Pages are
 ordered in a hierarchical structure that gives it the look and feel of an
 outliner.
 
 This tool can be used to keep track of TODO lists or ideas, to take notes
 during a meeting or to draft any other kind of text (blog entries,
 important mails, etc.).
